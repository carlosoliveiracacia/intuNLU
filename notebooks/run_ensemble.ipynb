      "summarize: Tanks were seen on the streets and explosions could be heard throughout the day in Libya's second-biggest city. General Khalifa Haftar, who accuses the government of supporting terrorism, began an assault against Islamist fighters in the city last month. The government in Tripoli says Gen Haftar has no authority to act, but several army units have joined him. The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli says a battalion within one of the biggest rival militias has also defected to join the general. The clashes on Sunday were said to have been some of the worst since Gen Haftar began his offensive against Islamists, dubbed \"Operation Dignity,\" in May. Residents told the BBC that explosions could be heard across the city intermittently for several hours. An electricity plant was also hit by rockets, causing power outages in large parts of Benghazi. Many residents who live in the area where the fighting erupted fled their homes to stay with relatives or friends in quieter neighbourhoods. The number of casualties remains unclear but doctors in the city said at least six people had been killed and a dozen more injured. A spokesman for Gen Haftar's force told local media that they had seized several senior Islamists as part of their offensive, but this could not be independently verified. Since launching his offensive, Gen Haftar has rallied support from the public and members of the security forces. He survived an assassination attempt earlier in June after a suicide bomb attack on his home in the town of Abyar, about 60km (37 miles) east of Benghazi. Libya is still in turmoil three years after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, with political, religious and political factions locked in disagreement about the country's future.

      "summarize: At least two missiles were fired at a house in North Waziristan tribal region early on Wednesday, the deadliest drone attack in Pakistan this year. It is the third such attack since new PM Nawaz Sharif won elections in May. He has demanded an end to such attacks. A government statement said the strike violated Pakistan's sovereignty. \"Pakistan has repeatedly emphasised the importance of bringing an immediate end to drone strikes,\" a foreign ministry spokesman said. \"They are counter-productive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives and have human rights and humanitarian implications.\" In a separate development, at least six security personnel are reported to have been killed and at least six more injured in an early morning attack by militants at a checkpoint near Peshawar. At least two more are reported to be missing, possibly kidnapped by the attackers. Reports citing local officials said most of those killed in the drone strike were thought to be from the militant Haqqani group. Officials say four missiles were fired by a US drone, targeting two houses and two vehicles, near Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan. A number of other people were also injured. The Haqqani network has been described by US military commanders as one of the most resilient militant groups operating in Afghanistan. The troubled border region is a known stronghold for al-Qaeda and Taliban militants. Seven people were killed in a similar strike on 8 June, also in North Waziristan, just three days after the new prime minister was sworn in. After that incident the Pakistani government summoned a senior US diplomat in protest, condemning what it called a \"violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity\". At least two key leaders of the Pakistani Taliban have been killed in earlier US drone strikes this year. Mullah Nazir was killed in January and Waliur Rehman was killed in May, shortly after Mr Sharif swept to election victory. The BBC's Richard Galpin in Islamabad says that the latest air strike by US forces will further heighten tensions between Washington and the new Pakistani government. Mr Sharif has called for a joint strategy to stop US drone strikes. The issue is hugely controversial in Pakistan, where parts of the government and military have often been accused of criticising the use of drones in public, but co-operating in private. Drone strikes are a source of severe tension between the US and Pakistan. It is estimated that between 2004 and 2013, CIA drone attacks in Pakistan killed up to 3,460 people. About 890 of them were civilians and the vast majority of strikes were carried out by the Obama administration, research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism said. Earlier this year, Mr Obama called the strikes part of a legitimate campaign against terrorism, but he also pledged more programme transparency and stricter targeting rules.\n",
